								<h1>Music</h1>
								<p>Despite my focus in my academic career, I have always tried hard to maintain a variety of personal interests and activities that I love. During my time in Portugal I have participated in several classical music activities such as integrating orchestras, playing solo or playing with small ensembles notwithstanding I have an eclectic taste for different genres.</p>

								<p><br/></p>
								<p>My activities as a musician can be summarised in the following list (I keep such very good memories of all these times): flutist in <a href="https://www.sfcrestuma.com/" target="_blank">Crestuma Wind Band</a> (Jan 2013 - Jul 2016), conductor/responsible for a small kids choral in my Parish (Dec 2012 - Jul 2016), flutist in the Jazz Group of Faculty (Nov 2012 - Nov 2015) and flute teacher (Sep 2014 - Dec 2015)</p>

								<p><br/>With hard work, even an amateur wind band can make good music. Just as an example, look at such a beautiful music I gladly participated in (<a href="https://www.sfcrestuma.com/" target="_blank">Crestuma Wind Band</a> got a 2nd place in this music contest!):</p>

								<h1>Doing good</h1>
								<p>"Doing good" is rather a very generic thing, but I do think that what we do in our lives must be not only centered on us. More and more we see examples of egoism, divisions, fear, and that's why I kindly let this section in my personal webpage.
									I hope this section can be useful to you to get ideas to improve our world, one step at a time. <strong>Please, feel free to drop me an email if you want to discuss or ask something related with this, good or bad!</strong>
								<br/><br/></p>

								<p>Fortunately, I had quite a few good experiences:
								</p>
								<h2><a href="http://www.missaopais.pt" target="_blank">Missão País</a> (Feb 2015, Feb 2016)</h2>
								<p>Missão País (Nation Mission) is a catholic project in which college students go to a village and help the people there during one week in February. Each faculty goes to a different place. In my case, around 50 students from my Faculty went one week in February to Vila Nova de Foz Côa (Portugal) and helped in the Retirement Home by talking to the old people, animated children (with and without disabilities), knocked doors looking whether someone needed help, went to a local school talking about the project and animated local catholic masses
								</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.ograo.com" target="_blank">Grão</a> (Nov 2015 - Sep 2016)</h2>
								<p>Grão (Grain, in Portuguese) is a volunteer project with a Jesuit inspiration, formed by university students and young professionals in Porto, Portugal. Grão aims to promote development missions during the Summer in Portuguese-speaking African countries working with NGOs and other local organisations in the field. From November to July, we have training sessions, intense fundraising events and regular volunteer actions. So, after nine months, a group of five girls and I went on a mission to Benguela, Angola, for two months. Two other missions were sent to Mozambique this Summer.<br/>
									Here it is one video per each mission (Benguela, Fonte Boa and Lifidzi) with few nice moments:

								<h1>Some pointers that might be useful</h1>

								<h2><a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="_blank">80000 Hours</a></h2>
								<p>You will probably spend 80000 hours in your career. So, 80k Hours aims at providing the best advice and help for the ones who want to have a social impact. Some suggestions are not as obvious as you might think.
								</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">Effective Altruism</a></h2>
								<p>Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to improve the world. Rather than just doing what feels right, they use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" target="_blank">Giving What We Can</a></h2>
								<p>Giving What We Can is a community of effective givers. They inspire people to donate significantly and as effectively as possible. Have you considered doing a pledge to donate just a small amount of your income to the best charities? Have a look!
