										<h2>Supervised Classification/Regression for Brain Graph Data</h2>
										<p>We can see the brain as a graph, in which nodes are brain regions and edges either a physical or a functional connection. Thus, we can tailor machine learning and deep learning methodologies for graphs [1,2] to aid physicians. The aim of this project is to use multi-modal graphs of healthy people (big data available from the Human Connectome Project) to predict categorical or continuous variables (e.g. age, clinical disability score, personality score, â€¦). Understand and interpret what factors contribute to those predictions is extremely interesting for clinicians as an application, and can lead to new methodological developments.

										<h2>Understanding Parkinson's Disease using Multimodal Brain Imaging</h2>
										<p>It is known that neurodegenerative diseases impact the brain in many different ways, including reduction in cortical thickness and grey matter volume, as well as a reduction in functional connectivity between brain regions. For this project, the student will have access to the public dataset PPMI [1], preprocessed by collaborators from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, specifically for feature-engineered cortical thicknesses and grey matter volume, as well as the functional connectome generated from the fMRI scans. The objective is to apply Machine Learning methodologies to understand the factors that contribute to disease and clinical profiles. A unique aspect of this project the development of methodologies that take advantage of the multimodality data of PPMI [2].
