# Profile
profile: |
  <strong>Hi!</strong> <br />
  I am Tiago Azevedo, a research associate at the <a class="career-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science and Technology, at the University of Cambridge</a>. In this same department, I completed a PhD degree in computer science under the supervision of <a target="_blank"  class="career-link"  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/">Prof. Pietro Lio'</a>, where I explored applications of machine learning in neuroscientific and genetic scenarios with a focus on graph representation learning. I was previously a research scientist at <a target="_blank"  class="career-link"  href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a>, where I worked with efficient probabilistic ML modelling and graph neural networks.<br /><br />

  I broadly like to research applications of artificial intelligence in the real world, with a particular interest in the medical and biological domains. I leave some details about me in this website, but please feel free to contact me for a more detailed CV.<br /><br />
